Since the ATM uses a simple RSA verification with an exponent = 3,
so we look for signature^3 = 1 mod n
this occures for the signature = 1.
We also define the status as the status value written in the q2-atm.py file.
The function returns a ServerResponse object with a status of approval and a signature of 1 that the ATM will accept as valid.
