This function tries to find the original PIN number that was encrypted using the ATMâ€™s encryption method. 
It does this by trying every possible 4-digit PIN (from 0000 to 9999), 
encrypting each one using the ATM ecrypt method, and checking if it matches the given encrypted value.
If it finds a match, it returns the original PIN. If not, it returns -1.
