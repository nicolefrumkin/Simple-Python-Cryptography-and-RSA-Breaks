As written in the file, the ATM uses an RSA algorithm with exponent 3.
Meaning we just need to find the cubic root of it.
Because the credit card number is rather short, we can do it quickly.
It calculates the cube root of the encrypted number and checks a small
range of nearby numbers to find the one that after encryption matches the input. 
This helps us not to iterate over all the possible billion numbers of the card.
If it finds the original number, it returns it. otherwise, it returns -1.
